# Day 1 - Java Journey 🚀

## 📚 What I Learned
- Basic Java syntax
- How to compile and run Java programs
- Understanding of main() method
- Variables and data types

## 💻 Programs Written
- HelloWorld.java
- AdditionOfTwoNumbers.java
- SimpleInterest.java

## ⚔ One Challenge
Understanding how compilation works (javac vs java command)

## 🎯 Tomorrow’s Goal
Learn about condition statements (if-else) and loops.





# 📅 Day 2 – Control Flow & Loops

## ✅ Topics Covered
- if statement
- if-else
- else-if ladder
- Nested if
- for loop
- while loop
- do-while loop

---

## 💻 Programs Written

### 🔹 If-Else Practice
- EvenOdd.java
- LargestOfThree.java
- GradeCalculator.java
- PositiveNegativeZero.java

### 🔹 Loop Practice
- Print1To100.java
- SumOfNumbers.java
- MultiplicationTable.java
- Factorial.java
- ReverseNumber.java

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How decision-making works in Java.
- Difference between `=` and `==`.
- How loops reduce repetitive code.
- Importance of condition order.
- Basic logical thinking improvement.

---

## 🏋️ LeetCode Practice
- Fizz Buzz
- Running Sum of 1D Array

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
- Initially confused between `==` and `=`
- Made small syntax mistakes in loop conditions
- Debugged wrong factorial logic once

---

## 📈 Progress Reflection
Today I feel more confident with control flow.
Loops make problem solving much easier.
Starting to think in logic rather than just syntax.





# Day 3 - Java Journey 🚀

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to declare and initialize arrays in Java
- How array indexing works (0-based indexing)
- How to traverse arrays using loops
- Performing operations like sum, largest element, and reverse
- Understanding memory representation of arrays

## 💻 Programs Written
- SumOfArray.java
- LargestElement.java
- ReverseArray.java
- AverageOfArray.java

## ⚔ One Challenge
Initially got confused while reversing the array because of incorrect index handling. 
Understanding how to swap elements properly using start and end pointers required careful thinking.

## 🎯 Tomorrow’s Goal
Start working on String programs and basic pattern problems.




# 📅 Day 4 – Array Logic Building

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Array traversal
- Conditional filtering (even, odd, negative numbers)
- Second largest element logic
- Array sorting check
- In-place array reversal
- Duplicate detection
- Frequency counting
- Armstrong number logic

---

## 💻 Programs Implemented
1. Print all even numbers from array
2. Count negative numbers
3. Sum of odd numbers
4. Find second largest element
5. Check if array is sorted
6. Reverse array without using new array
7. Find duplicate elements
8. Check Armstrong number
9. Print frequency of each element

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
- Difference between index-based loop and enhanced for-loop
- Importance of boundary conditions in arrays
- Using Integer.MIN_VALUE for comparison logic
- Nested loops for duplicate detection
- Time complexity awareness (O(n²) cases)

---

## ⚡ Challenges Faced
- Handling second largest element correctly
- Avoiding duplicate printing in frequency program
- Understanding Armstrong number logic clearly

---

## 🎯 Improvements for Tomorrow
- Learn HashMap to optimize duplicate & frequency problems
- Start practicing time complexity analysis
- Solve 3-5 array problems on LeetCode

### 🔥 Streak Status
Day 4/180 Completed ✅  
Consistency > Motivation




Day 5 – Strings & Patterns

Learned:
- String methods
- String traversal
- equals vs ==
- Nested loop pattern logic

Observation:
Pattern printing improved my nested loop thinking.
Need more practice in pyramid alignment.
